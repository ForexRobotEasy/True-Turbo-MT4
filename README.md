## Code Overview

The code is written in MQL4 and implements a trading strategy based on identifying overbought and oversold conditions in the Asian session. Here's a breakdown of the code structure:

### identifyOverboughtConditions()

This function is responsible for identifying overbought conditions in the Asian session. It calculates the average price in the Asian session and checks if the current price is above this average. If the condition is met, it executes trades based on the identified overbought conditions.

### identifyOversoldConditions()

This function is responsible for identifying oversold conditions in the Asian session. It calculates the average price in the Asian session and checks if the current price is below this average. If the condition is met, it executes trades based on the identified oversold conditions.

### tradingStrategy()

This main function implements the overall trading strategy. It calls the `identifyOverboughtConditions()` and `identifyOversoldConditions()` functions to identify trading opportunities. It also incorporates risk management principles to prevent unnecessary risk exposure.

### handleErrors()

This function handles errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.

### OnInit()

This is the entry point of the program and is called when the program is initialized. It initializes necessary variables and parameters and calls the `tradingStrategy()` function.

### OnTick()

This function is executed on each tick of the market. It updates the current price and calls the `tradingStrategy()` function.

### OnDeinit()

This function is called when the program is terminated. It cleans up resources and closes any open trades.

### calculateAsianSessionAverage()
